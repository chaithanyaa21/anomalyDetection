Project Title:  Anomaly Detection using Isolation Forest and Local Outlier Factor

Project Description:  The goal of this project is to develop an anomaly detection system using two popular techniques: Isolation Forest and Local Outlier Factor (LOF). By leveraging these algorithms, we aim to develop a robust anomaly detection system capable of accurately identifying outliers and detecting anomalous patterns in complex datasets.
